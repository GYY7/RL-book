    Returns the approximated value
    function after each episode.

    Approximates Tabular MC Prediction with a discrete domain of states S, without any
    interpolation. The value function for each S is maintained as a weighted
    mean of observations by recency (managed by
    `count_to_weight_func').

    In practice, this means you can use this to approximate a function
    with a learning rate Î±(n) specified by count_to_weight_func.


    Fields:
    values_map -- mapping from S to its approximated value function
    counts_map -- how many times a given S has been updated
    count_to_weight_func -- function for how much to weigh an update
      to S based on the number of times that S has been updated

    Update the value approximation with the given points.
